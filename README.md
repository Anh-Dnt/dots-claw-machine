# Claw, Catch, Cuddle!

Claw, Catch, Cuddle! is a fun, retro-inspired 2D claw machine game with a pixel art twist. In this game, players use the claw to pick up adorable, pixelated stuffed animals and drop them in a designated drop area to earn points. Each animal type comes with its own charm and point valueâ€”and a special animal grants double points!

## Inspiration

The project is inspired by the classic arcade claw machines that many of us loved as kids. I wanted to reimagine that experience with modern coding techniques and a retro, pixelated aesthetic. The project not only pays homage to old-school gaming but also serves as a platform to learn and experiment with game mechanics, pixel art design, and state management in JavaScript and Canvas.
